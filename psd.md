# Project Specification Document

## **Project Title**
**Deep Learning-Based Radar Target Classification Using Micro-Doppler Signatures**

---

## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a **deep learning model** to classify radar targets based on their **micro-Doppler (μ-D) signatures**. Micro-Doppler features provide detailed motion characteristics of targets, making them valuable for **automated target recognition (ATR)** in defense, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance applications.

### **1.2 Motivation**
- **Enhanced Radar Perception**: Micro-Doppler signatures help distinguish between drones, birds, vehicles, and human movements.
- **AI for Real-Time Classification**: Traditional signal processing methods are limited; deep learning provides **higher accuracy** and **real-time processing**.
- **Practical Applications**:
  - **Military & Defense**: Identify airborne threats (e.g., drones vs. birds).
  - **Autonomous Vehicles**: Improve object detection in poor visibility.
  - **Surveillance & Security**: Classify human activities via radar sensing.
